## Print an image of the animal

## Description

One of the most important parts of working with animals is keeping an eye on them. We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? Now we are ready to print something awesome: an image of an animal!

## Objectives

For the second stage, you will need to develop an animal printer. Your program should display the animal identified in the code field.

## Example

Your output should contain the following ASCII image:

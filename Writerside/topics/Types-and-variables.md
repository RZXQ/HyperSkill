# Types and variables

In programming, a **[variable](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3518)** is a placeholder for storing a value of a particular **type:** a string, a number, or something else. In this topic, you will learn how to [declare](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3518)and use variables in Java programs.

## Declaring and initializing

Every variable has a **name** (also known as **an identifier)** to distinguish it from others. Before you start using a variable, you must declare it. The general form of [declaration](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3518) is the following:

```java
DataType variableName = initialization;
```

The left part of this [statement](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3518) describes the variable, and the right part describes something that is assigned to it.

- The **type** (or **data type)** of a variable determines what possible operations can be performed on the variable and which values can be stored in it. Here we use a non-existent data type (**DataType**) to demonstrate the general form of declaration.
- The **name** (or **identifier)** distinguishes the variable from others. The name of a variable cannot start with a digit; it usually starts with a letter. Always try to choose meaningful and readable names for variables to make your code easy to understand.
- The **assignment** **operator** denoted as `=` is used to assign a single value or a result of an [expression](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3518) to a variable.
- The **[initialization](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3518)** is a value or a result of an expression that is assigned to the variable.

According to this declaration, we can declare a variable of the type **String** and assign the word **"java"** to it:

```java
String language = "java";
```

We can also declare a variable of the type `int` to store an integer number:

```java
int numberOfApples = 5;
```



The case in the name of a variable makes a difference: `language` is not the same as `Language`.



Variables can store not only strings and numbers, but also characters and other [data types](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3518) which we will learn about later in the next topics.

## Accessing the value of a variable

Once a variable has been declared, its value can be accessed and modified using the name. In the example below, we declare a variable and then print it:

```java
String dayOfWeek = "Monday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); // Monday
```

It is also possible to assign a value of one variable to another one:

```java
int one = 1;
int num = one;
System.out.println(num); // 1
```

One important feature of variables is that they can be changed. You don't need to declare a variable again to change its value; just assign a new value to it using the `=`operator.

Let's declare a variable named `dayOfWeek` and print its value before and after changing:

```java
String dayOfWeek = "Monday";
System.out.println(dayOfWeek); // Monday

dayOfWeek = "Tuesday";
        System.out.println(dayOfWeek); // Tuesday
```

There is one restriction for variables: you can only assign a value of the same type as the type of the initial variable. So, the following code is not correct:

```java
int number = 10;
number = 11; // ok
number = "twelve"; // it does not work!
```

## Alternative forms of declaration

There are several alternative forms of declaration which are less commonly used in practice. Here are a couple of them shown with examples..

- Declaring several variables of the same type as a single statement:

```java
String language = "java", version = "8 or newer";
```

- Separating declaration and initialization into statements:

```java
int age; // declaration
age = 35; // initialization 
```

However, as we have already noted, these forms are rarely used.

## Type inference

Since Java 10, you can write **var** instead of a specific type to force [automatic type inference](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3518) based on the type of assigned value:

```java
var variableName = initialization;
```

Here are two examples below:

```java
var language = "Java"; // String
var version = 10; // int
```

This feature can be a bit controversial: on the one hand, it allows your code to be more concise. On the other hand, since it doesn't indicate the type explicitly, it may affect the code readability in a bad way. For now, it's enough to understand the basic idea. We will not use type inference in our theory so that our educational platform is suitable for people who use earlier versions of Java. But if you would like to practice it, you may use type inference in our exercises as they fully support Java 10.

## Conclusion

Variables in Java are used to store values of different data types. They need to be declared with a type and a name. Variables can be modified after declaration, but the new value must be of the same type as the old one. In Java 10, the **var** keyword was introduced for automatic type inference.

> You've learned the essentials of declaring and using variables in Java. With this understanding, you're well-prepared to start writing simple programs and experimenting with different types of data. Keep practicing, as this will lead you to work on educational projects on our platform and, eventually, in your real developer's routine.

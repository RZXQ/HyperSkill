## Work on project. Stage 2/5:Introduce yourself

Project: [Simple Chat Bot with Java](https://hyperskill.org/projects/113)

## Introduce yourself

## Description

The greeting part is great, but chatbots are also supposed to interact with a user. It's time to implement this functionality.

## Objective

In this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.

Your program should print the following lines:

```no-highlight
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {yourName}!
```

You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.

Instead of `{yourName}`, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.

## Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:** *a dialogue with the bot*

```no-highlight
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
```

Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text but not the number of printed lines.

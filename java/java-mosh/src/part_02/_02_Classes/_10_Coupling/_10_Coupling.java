 * Coupling: The level of dependency between classes. Higher coupling means classes are
 * more dependent on each other, making the system more complex and harder to maintain.
 *
 * By reducing the number of methods a class exposes, we can decrease coupling. For
 * example, changing getters to private methods reduces the number of exposed methods,
 * thereby reducing coupling.

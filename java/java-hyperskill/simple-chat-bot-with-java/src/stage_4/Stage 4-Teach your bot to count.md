## Work on project. Stage 4/5:Teach your bot to count

Project: [Simple Chat Bot with Java](https://hyperskill.org/projects/113)

## Teach your bot to count

## Description

Now you will teach your bot to count. It's going to become an expert in numbers!

## Objective

In this stage, you will program the bot to count from 0 to any positive number users enter.

## Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:** *a dialogue with the new version of the bot*

```no-highlight
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 5
0!
1!
2!
3!
4!
5!
Completed, have a nice day!
```

**Note:** each number starts with a new line, and after a number, the bot should print the exclamation mark.

Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text if you want, but be especially careful when counting numbers.

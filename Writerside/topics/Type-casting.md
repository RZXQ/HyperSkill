# Type casting

Suppose you need to assign a value of one type to a variable of another type. To do that, your program needs to cast the source type to the [target type](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3510). Java provides two kinds of casting for [primitive types](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3510):**implicit** and **explicit**. The first one is performed automatically by the Java compiler when it is possible, while the second one can only be done by a programmer.

## Implicit casting

The compiler automatically performs **[implicit casting](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3510)** when the target type is wider than the source type. The picture below illustrates the direction of this casting. Any value of a given type can be assigned to the one on the right implicitly or below in the case of `char`.

**The** **direction** **of** **implicit** **primitive** **type** **castings**

Normally, there is no loss of information when the target type is wider than the source type, for example, when we cast `int` to `long`. But it is not possible to automatically cast in the backward order (e.g. from `long` to `int` or from `double` to `float`).





> Note that there is no `boolean` type on the picture above because it is impossible to cast this type to any other and vice versa.





Here are several examples of implicit castings:

- from `int` to `long`:

```java
int num = 100;
long bigNum = num; // 100L
```

- from `long` to `double`:

```java
long bigNum = 100_000_000L;
double bigFraction = bigNum; // 100000000.0
```

- from `short` to `int`:

```java
short shortNum = 100;
int num = shortNum; // 100
```

- from `char` to `int`:

```java
char ch = '?';
int code = ch; // 63
```

In some cases, implicit [type casting](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3510) may result in some information loss. When we convert an `int` to `float`, or a `long` to `float` or to `double`, we may lose some less significant bits of the value, which will result in a loss of precision. However, the result of this conversion will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value, which will be in the overall range of the target type. To understand that, check out the example:

```java
long bigLong =  1_200_000_002L;
float bigFloat = bigLong; // 1.2E9 (= 1_200_000_000)
```

When we convert a `char` to an `int` in Java, we actually get the ASCII value for a given character. The ASCII value is an integer representation of English alphabet letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and other symbols. [Here](https://ascii.cl/) you can find some of the standard symbols in ASCII.

```java
char character = 'a';
char upperCase = 'A';

int ascii1 = character; // this is 97
int ascii2 = upperCase; // this is 65
```





> Strictly speaking, Java uses Unicode Character Representations (UTF-16), which is a superset of ASCII and includes a by far larger set of symbols. However, the numbers 0–127 have the same values in ASCII and Unicode.





As you can see, implicit casting works absolutely transparently.

## Explicit casting

The considered **implicit casting** does not work when the target type is narrower than the source type. But programmers can apply **explicit casting** to a source type to get another type they want. It may lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value and may also lose precision.

To perform explicit casting, a programmer must write the target type in parentheses before the source.

```java
(targetType) source
```

Any possible casting not presented in the picture above needs such an approach, for example `double`to `int`, and `long` to `char`.

Examples:

```java
double d = 2.00003;

// it loses the fractional part
long l =  (long) d; // 2

// requires explicit casting because long is wider than int
int i = (int) l; // 2 

// requires explicit casting because the result is long (indicated by L)
int val = (int) (3 + 2L); // 5

// casting from a long literal to char
char ch = (char) 55L; // '7'
```

However, the explicit casting may truncate the value because `long` and `double` can store a much larger number than `int`.

```java
long bigNum = 100_000_000_000_000L;
int n = (int) bigNum; // 276447232
```

Oops! The value has been truncated. This problem is known as **[type overflow](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3510)**. The same problem may occur when casting `int` to `short` or `byte`. Let's see what happens exactly.

As you remember, in Java `long` is a 64-bit number, while `int` is 32-bit. When converting `long` to `int`the program just takes the last 32 bits to represent the new number. If the `long` contains a number less than or equal to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` you can convert it by casting without losing information. Otherwise, the result will be quite meaningless, although determined. That is why you shouldn't perform casting from a larger type to a smaller type unless you are absolutely sure that it is necessary and that truncation will not interfere with your program.

Explicit casting also works when implicit casting is enough.

```java
int num = 10;
long bigNum = (long) num; // redundant casting
```

But this is redundant and should not be used to avoid unnecessary constructs in your code.





> **Note,** that despite the power of explicit casting, it is still impossible to cast something to and from the `boolean` type.





## Conclusion

If you want to cast a narrower type to a wider type, you do not need to write anything, the Java [compiler](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3510)will do it automatically for you. But if you want the opposite, specify the required type in parentheses following the [assignment operator](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3510). Keep in mind, the `boolean` type cannot be cast to another type and vice versa.

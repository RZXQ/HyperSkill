# For loop

Sometimes we need to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. To do this, Java provides the `for` loop. This loop is often used to iterate over a range of values or through an array. If the number of iterations or the range borders are known, it is recommended to use the `for` loop. If they are unknown, the `while` loop may be the preferable solution.

## The basic syntax

The `for` loop has the following basic [syntax](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3505):

```java
for (initialization; condition; modification) {
    // do something
} 
```

Parts of the loop:

- the **[initialization statement](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3505)** is executed once before the loop begins; usually, loop variables are initialized here;
- the **condition** is a Boolean expression that determines the need for the next iteration; if it's `false`, the loop terminates;
- the **modification** is a statement that changes the value of the loop [variables](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3505); it is invoked after each iteration of the loop; usually, it uses **increment or decrement** to modify the loop's variable.

Inside the loop's body, the program can perform any correct Java statements. It can even contain other loops.

The order of execution for any `for` loop is always the same:

1. the initialization statement;
2. if the condition is `false` then terminate the loop;
3. if the condition is `true`, then the loop's body is executed;
4. the modification is performed;
5. go to stage 2 (condition).

Let's write a loop for printing integer numbers from 0 to 9 on the same line.

```java
int n = 9;
for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    System.out.print(i + " "); // here, a space is used to separate numbers
}
```

The code displays:

```java
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
```

The variables [declared](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/3505) in the initialization statement are visible only inside the scope that includes all parts of the loop: the condition, the body, and the modification. The integer loop variables are often named `i`, `j`, `k`, or `index`.

Hereâ€™s another example. Let's calculate the sum of the integer numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) using the `for` loop.

```java
int startIncl = 1, endExcl = 11;

int sum = 0;
for (int i = startIncl; i < endExcl; i++) {
    sum += i;
}

System.out.println(sum); // it prints "55"
```

## Skipping parts

The initialization statement, the condition, and the modification parts are optional, the `for` loop might not have all of them.

It is possible to declare a variable outside the loop:



```java
int i = 10;
for (; i > 0; i--) {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}
```

Moreover, it is also possible to write an infinite loop without these parts at all:

```java
for (;;) {
    // do something
}
```

## Nested loops

It's possible to nest one `for` loop in another `for`loop. This approach is used to process multidimensional structures like tables (matrices), data cubes, and so on.



As an example, the following code prints the multiplication table of numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive).



```java
for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
        System.out.print(i * j + "\t");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
```



It outputs:



```java
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  
2   4   6   8   10  12  14  16  18  
3   6   9   12  15  18  21  24  27  
4   8   12  16  20  24  28  32  36  
5   10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  
6   12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  
7   14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  
8   16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  
9   18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81 
```

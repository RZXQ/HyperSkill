## Work on project. Stage 1/5:Meet your chat bot

Project: [Simple Chat Bot with Java](https://hyperskill.org/projects/113)

## Meet your chat bot

## Description

Digital personal assistants help people drive cars, plan their day, and buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

In this project, you will develop, step by step, a simple bot that will help you study programming.

## Objective

For the first stage, you will write a bot that displays a greeting, its name, and the year it was created. First impressions count!

Your program should print the following lines:

```no-highlight
Hello! My name is {botName}.
I was created in {birthYear}.
```

Instead of `{botName}`, print any name you choose and replace `{birthYear}` with the current year (four digits). You don't need to take any input at this stage.

## Example

Output:

```no-highlight
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2023.
```

Here's the result with your bot named **Aid** and **2023** as its birth year. Feel free to modify the values, but make sure to print exactly two lines.

## Work on project. Stage 1/3:Print the prices

Project: [My First Project with Java](https://hyperskill.org/projects/380)

## Print the prices

## Theory

Welcome to your first Java project! On Hyperskill, a **project** is a practical task where you apply skills from theoretical topics. Each project is a complete application: a game, a search engine, etc. To help you grasp the idea, let's write a simple net income calculator in this one!

This is the first **stage** in the project, a step in its development. For example, you can't create a Tetris game in one take; instead, break down the task into smaller steps â€” designing a game board or a menu. Same with our projects, each consists of multiple stages.

Below, you will find a **description** that gives a context behind what you should do. **Objectives** state the main task of the stage and the details.

Write your code in the Code Editor below and press *Run Solution* to check it. If your solution is correct, move to the second stage by pressing *Continue*.

## Description

You've recently opened a new corner shop. It is relatively small; it contains only a bubblegum, toffee, ice cream, milk chocolate, doughnuts, and pancakes. The first version of the program will display a list of all the products with their prices.

## Objectives

- Print the `Prices:` line;
- Print the item names and prices from the Example below. Your output format should follow it.

## Example

**Example 1**: *output at the end of this stage*

```no-highlight

Bubblegum: $2
Toffee: $0.2
Ice cream: $5
Milk chocolate: $4
Doughnut: $2.5
